#### JVM options for smoother Android Studio experience

###### Tired of slow Android Studio? 
Yeah, me too.

Here are some `vmoptions` I use for Android Studio, it starts **faster** and runs **smoother** than on default options.

You will find all installation instuctions in the [studio.vmoptions file](studio.vmoptions), feel free to open issues and PRs!

-----------
JVM Options target HotSpot JRE 8, all of them are compatible with Mac OS, Linux and Windows.

##### Download
See [studio.vmoptions file](studio.vmoptions).
